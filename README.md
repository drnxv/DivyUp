# Bitcamp 2023 Project
* Collaborators: Pranav Chavali, Arnav Panda, Adithya Pradosh, Pranav Peddamalla
* Description: Our application, DivyUp, makes the process of splitting a group bill significantly easier. We allow users to enter their group members for the order and then scan the receipt they were given. After this, the app displays each persons name and their respective share for the order.
